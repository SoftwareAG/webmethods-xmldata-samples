# webmethods-xmldata-samples
This project contains sample Flow and Java code utilizng the new XmData infoset introduced with Intergation Server release 10.1.
This new format encodes the XML infoset using IData in a format that is much more robust than the legacy format.  Full support for schema constructs such as nested and repeating model groups,  substitution groups, any wildcards, and other advanced features is included.  Many new helper classes are included that simplify usage of the new infoset from within Java services.  The helpers make it possible to use Document Types to map the infoset from within a Java service.  The new XmlData infoset and services exists in parallel with the legacy infoset and services.
